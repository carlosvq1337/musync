MuSync is a personal project, developed on my free time out of my love for music and web development.

## About

MuSync is meant to provide the average music enjoyer with the capabilitiy to convert their playlists from one music service platform to another with ease, while recommending new music that they have probably never heard before, yet, they're likely to enjoy.

### Stack

This web application was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (a React framework), and the [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) component library for React.

### APIs

In order to access Spotify user information, song data, and music metadata of interest, I made use of the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

For the playlist conversion functionality, so far I plan to make use of the [Youtube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3), as this is the only other platform I plan to support (initially) besides Spotify at the moment.
